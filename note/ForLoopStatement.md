## Syntax

```go
for [condition | (init; condition; increment) | Range] {
    statement(s);
}
```

The flow of control is as follows:

* If a **condition** is available, then for loop executes as long as condition is true.

* If a **for** clause that is **(init; condition; increment)** is present then ...

* If **range** is available, then the for loop executes for each item in the range.
